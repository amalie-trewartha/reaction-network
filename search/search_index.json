Installing rxn-network \u00b6 The rxn-network package has several dependencies, most of which can be installed through PyPI. However, graph-tool must be installed through a more customized method; please see https://graph-tool.skewed.de/ for more details. We recommend the following installation procedure to create a new conda environment: conda create -n gt python=3.9 And then install graph-tool through conda-forge: conda install - c conda - forge graph - tool To install an editable version of the rxn-network code, simply download (clone) the code from this repository, navigate to its directory in terminal, and then run the following command to install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt And then to finally install an editable version of the package: pip install -e . Demo \u00b6 A demo Jupyter notebook (demo.ipynb) contains the code necessary to replicate the results of the paper and is a good starting template for using the rxn-network package. Note: this needs to be updated! How to cite rxn-network \u00b6 The following paper explains the methodology of the rxn-network package: McDermott, M. J., Dwaraknath, S. S., and Persson, K. A. (2021).
